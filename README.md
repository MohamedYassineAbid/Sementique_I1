## Semantic Web Application for Higher Education
Project Overview
This project implements a Semantic Web application for Aix-Marseille University. It demonstrates how Semantic Web technologies can improve data management and information exchange in higher education. By leveraging RDF, RDFS, and SPARQL, the application models various university components, such as departments, roles, campuses, and subjects, and provides meaningful insights through semantic queries.

## Domain Definition
The chosen domain is a higher education institution, exemplified by Aix-Marseille University. This domain was selected due to its complexity and need for efficient data management. Universities consist of diverse entities like faculties, departments, and roles, which benefit from the semantic relationships provided by RDF and RDFS. The project's goal is to highlight how Semantic Web technologies can facilitate better organization and service delivery within such institutions.
